    "bio": "I have been a Web Developer for over 13 years (Frontend mostly, but also Fullstack).I had experience working as a single web developer, as a member of big teams in FinTech, and as a Team Lead of a small team. I enjoyed working on web 3D projects, awesome animations, visualizations, and good infographics. I am a speaker & organizer of tech meetups and conferences. I helped many students at different schools with learning web development. I like tech communities and modern technologies. Last 7 years, I have been living in Luxembourg and holding a Luxembourg JavaScript meetup.In 2023 I started to work as a Developer Relations Engineer at Kadena. My passion is 🎮 video/board games, 🏞️ traveling, 🤿 diving, animals (I have a red cat 🐈), and cinema 🎥. I collect children's books from different countries and Christmas tree decorations.",
